# 📦 Keet Drop-in Module

**Runtime-agnostic Keet integration for OpenClaw-family agents:** NanoBot, CoPaw/QwenPaw, Hermes-agent, and OpenClaw.

This version installs a **shared always-on Keet core** and keeps adapter behavior equivalent across all four runtimes from day one.

---

## 1) Reasons why Keet.io is a good choice for a channel with OpenClaw and OpenClaw clones

1. **Decentralized and secure messaging**: Keet.io is a decentralized messaging platform that allows users to communicate securely and privately without relying on a centralized server. This is especially important for OpenClaw and its clone users, as it enables them to maintain control over their data and communications.

2. **Efficient room management**: Keet's room management is ideal for maintaining multiple active chat sessions simultaneously, each as a separate session for the agent.

3. **Cross-machine collaboration**: With Keet, two or more agents running on separate machines can connect to communicate and collaborate.

4. **Easy‑to‑use clients and increased adoption**: Keet.io has desktop and mobile clients that are very easy to install and use. With a mechanism like this enabling users to interact with agents securely, efficiently, and intuitively, the adoption of Keet.io as a communication platform is likely to increase—both for human‑to‑agent communication and for humans communicating with other humans, preferring Keet.io over Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, etc.

## 2) What this module provides

| Capability | How it works |
|---|---|
| Shared always-on core | Installer generates `skills/keet-core/daemon.js` + `skills/keet-core/client.js` and exposes a JSON-RPC command/event API over a local Unix socket. |
| Long-lived room presence | `joinRoom` creates persistent sessions that remain active in the daemon (not one-shot send only). |
| Bidirectional flow | Inbound room traffic is emitted as events; adapters can watch and relay to their platform channel. |
| Session lifecycle | Create / join / send / leave / list sessions are all first-class commands. |
| Persistent state | Session metadata and storage live under `~/.nanobot/rooms/` and are restored on daemon restart. |
| Equivalent adapters | NanoBot (skills), CoPaw channel, Hermes plugin, and OpenClaw plugin call the same shared Node core and same command semantics. |

## 3) Installer behavior

Run:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pepeneif/keet-dropin-module/main/install_keet_dropin.sh)
```

The installer script [`install_keet_dropin.sh`](install_keet_dropin.sh) does the following:

1. Detects runtime: NanoBot / CoPaw / Hermes-agent / OpenClaw.
2. Installs Node `v20.12.0` inside the detected workspace (if absent).
3. Installs npm deps: `blind-pairing-core`, `hypercore-id-encoding`, `hypercore`, `random-access-file`.
4. Creates persistent storage: `~/.nanobot/rooms/` + `~/.nanobot/rooms/sessions/`.
5. Generates shared Keet core files:
   - `skills/keet-core/daemon.js`
   - `skills/keet-core/ensure_daemon.js`
   - `skills/keet-core/client.js`
6. Generates common skills:
   - `keet-create-room`
   - `keet-join-room`
   - `keet-send-message`
   - `keet-leave-room`
   - `keet-list-sessions`
7. Generates runtime adapter for CoPaw / Hermes / OpenClaw when relevant.

## 4) Command model (same across all runtimes)

### `keet-create-room`

Creates room metadata and returns JSON:

```json
{
  "roomId": "...",
  "inviteUrl": "pear://keet/...",
  "sessionId": "...",
  "roomName": "..."
}
```

### `keet-join-room`

Joins and keeps watching events (always-on behavior):

```bash
keet-join-room <pear://keet/...> [--session <id>] [--watch|--no-watch] [--no-stdin]
```

### `keet-send-message`

Sends to an active session (or joins first if needed):

```bash
keet-send-message <pear://keet/...> <message> [--session <id>]
```

### `keet-leave-room`

Stops one active session:

```bash
keet-leave-room <session-id>
```

### `keet-list-sessions`

Lists active daemon sessions:

```bash
keet-list-sessions
```

## 5) Platform usage examples

### NanoBot

```bash
nanobot agent -m "keet-create-room MyRoom"
nanobot agent -m "keet-join-room pear://keet/<id> --session <sid> --watch"
nanobot agent -m "keet-send-message pear://keet/<id> hello --session <sid>"
nanobot agent -m "keet-list-sessions"
nanobot agent -m "keet-leave-room <sid>"
```

### CoPaw / QwenPaw

```bash
copaw channel keet create MyRoom
copaw channel keet join pear://keet/<id> --session <sid>
copaw channel keet send pear://keet/<id> hello --session <sid>
copaw channel keet sessions
copaw channel keet leave <sid>
```

### Hermes-agent

```bash
hermes channel keet create MyRoom
hermes channel keet join pear://keet/<id> --session <sid>
hermes channel keet send pear://keet/<id> hello --session <sid>
hermes channel keet sessions
hermes channel keet leave <sid>
```

### OpenClaw

```bash
openclaw channel keet create MyRoom
openclaw channel keet join pear://keet/<id> --session <sid>
openclaw channel keet send pear://keet/<id> hello --session <sid>
openclaw channel keet list-sessions
openclaw channel keet leave-room <sid>
```

## 6) Architecture summary

Shared core generated by [`install_keet_dropin.sh`](install_keet_dropin.sh):

- **Daemon** (`daemon.js`): owns active session map, room streams, event queue, state persistence.
- **RPC API** (`client.js`): `createRoom`, `joinRoom`, `sendMessage`, `leaveRoom`, `listSessions`, `fetchEvents`.
- **Adapter contract** (all runtimes):
  - create
  - join (watch loop)
  - send
  - leave
  - sessions

This ensures Keet behaves like a real long-lived channel integration rather than a one-message-only transport.
